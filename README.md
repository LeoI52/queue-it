## 🎮 Gameplay

**Queue It!** is a Pyxel platformer where each collectible gem grants you a unique power but there' is a twist :  
You can only use them in the order they appear in your queue. This means you'll need to plan ahead and think creatively to overcome obstacles.

Originally created for **La Nuit du Code 2025**, the game was later expanded into a complete 16 level experience with polished visuals, animations, and sounds.

You can play Queue It ! on [itch.io](https://leo-imbert.itch.io/queue-it).
